# COOKING NOODLES

1. Cook noodles according to the package instructions. The noodles don't need to cooked till al dente. Since towards the end we will be just tossing the noodles with the stir fried veggies.
2. Drain the cooked noodles in a colander. Rinse noodles in running water very well. This method stops the cooking process.

3. Add Â½ tsp oil to the noodles. Toss them well, so that the oil gets coated evenly on the noodles. This method gets rid of stickiness from the noodles. Cover and keep the noodles aside.
4. When the noodles are cooking, you can chop & grate the veggies.
5. Prepare corn starch paste with 2 tsp corn starch and 2 tbsp water. Keep aside.

## MAKING CHOWMEIN

1. Heat oil in a pan or wok. On medium heat, first saute the green chilies, ginger and garlic for about 30 seconds. Green chilies add quite some heat in the dish. Skip if you do not prefer them or if making for kids.
2. Add chopped onions or spring onions. Saute for a minute.
3. Add sliced mushrooms and finely chopped french beans.
4. Stir and saute on a medium flame till the edges of the mushroom get lightly browned.
5. Add grated carrots, shredded cabbage and sliced bell pepper/capsicum.
6. Stir and increase the flame to a high. Stir fry everything on a high flame for 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Add soy sauce. At this step you can also add tomato sauce or red chili sauce or green chili sauce. Since I have already added green chilies, I have not added the chili sauce.
8. Season with black pepper or white pepper and salt.
9. Stir everything and then add the corn flour paste. Stir the corn flour paste very well before adding to the stir fried vegetables.
10. Stir and saute for a minute on medium flame.
11. Add the cooked noodles. Increase the flame to high. Mix and toss the noodles with the stir fried veggies.
12. Lastly add vinegar and give a final mix to chowmein. Switch off the flame.
13. Serve chow mein steaming hot in serving bowls. 
14. You can also garnish it with about 1 to 2 tsp toasted sesame seeds and spring onion greens.

#### NOTES

- Remember to keep all the sauces and seasonings ready when you begin to stir fry the veggies.
